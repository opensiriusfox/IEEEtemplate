% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create

% simpler here.)

(Sâ€™13) received the B.S. in Electrical Engineering \textit{summa cumme laude} with a from Washington State University in Pullman, WA in 2013. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in RF Microelectronics from Washington State University, Pullman, WA.

If you're reading this paragraph as a reviewer, then the person who submit the paper has forgotten to remove my template BIO from their document. You really should reject their paper, that's pretty sloppy.

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
